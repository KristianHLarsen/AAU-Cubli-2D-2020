# AAU-Cubli-2D 2020

The project is related to synchronising two 2D inverted pendulums, called Cublis, initially designed by ETH Zurich. The repository consists of the Arduino code for Cubli synchronisation and and a collection of arduino code sketches for a 7th semester project at Aalborg university. Furthermore a paper describing the contributions to the field has been included.
